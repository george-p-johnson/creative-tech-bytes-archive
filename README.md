Creative Tech Bytes Archive

Overview
- Static archive of Creative Tech Byte editions. Each edition is a standalone HTML email (`NN.0.html`).
- The landing page (`index.html`) is autogenerated from the edition files.

Generate index.html
1) Ensure Python 3 is available.
2) From the repo root, run:
   `python3 scripts/build_index.py`

Notes
- Do not edit `index.html` by hand; re-run the script instead.
- New editions: add a file named like `65.0.html` in the repo root and rerun the script. The latest numbers appear first automatically.
