Creative Tech Bytes Archive

Overview
- Static archive of Creative Tech Byte editions. Each edition is a standalone HTML email (`NN.0.html`).
- The landing page (`index.html`) is autogenerated from the edition files.
- Explore all article links across editions with a filterable UI (`explore.html`).

Generate index.html
1) Ensure Python 3 is available.
2) From the repo root, run:
   `python3 scripts/build_index.py`

Notes
- Do not edit `index.html` by hand; re-run the script instead.
- New editions: add a file named like `65.0.html` in the repo root and rerun the script. The latest numbers appear first automatically.
- The build also generates `manifest.json` used by `explore.html` to load edition pages.
 - The build also generates `articles.json`, a consolidated database with fields: `edition`, `title`, `url`, `image`, `description`, `tag`.

Explore all articles
- Open `explore.html` in a browser (same directory). It loads `manifest.json`, fetches each edition HTML, extracts external article links, and renders a searchable, filterable card grid.
- If your browser blocks `file://` fetch, serve the folder locally (e.g., VS Code Live Server) or host via GitHub Pages.
 - If `articles.json` exists (from the build), `explore.html` uses it directly for faster loading.
